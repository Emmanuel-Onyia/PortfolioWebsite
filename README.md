I have been trying to create a website visit counter
I used dynamodb to create a serverless storage and intialised a lambda function
The deployment worked but I tried curling and using the Ui link but there was an internal server error.
I searched to find out what it could mean and I fould it was a permissions issue. Lambdas IAM role does not have the getitem and put item policy.
I said fuckit and have it full access. FORNOW xD.
